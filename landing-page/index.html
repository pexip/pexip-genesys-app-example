    <p>Congrats! The integration widget was correctly installed. However, in order
      to use this integration, you will need to perform some additional configuration
      steps in Genesys and in Pexip Infinity. To help you with this task, we have
      two resources that will be very handy for you.

      <b>Genesys Documentation</b> contains all the information about how to
      configure this integration, and if you have any questions, feel free to
